(This section is copied from the GCC manual, by Richard Stallman.)
</P><P>

To protect our freedom from lawsuits like these, a group of programmers
and users have formed a new grass-roots political organization, the
League for Programming Freedom.
</P><P>

The purpose of the League is to oppose new monopolistic practices such
as user-interface copyright and software patents; it calls for a return
to the legal policies of the recent past, in which these practices were
not allowed.  The League is not concerned with free software as an
issue, and not affiliated with the Free Software Foundation.
</P><P>

The League's membership rolls include John McCarthy, inventor of Lisp,
Marvin Minsky, founder of the Artificial Intelligence lab, Guy L.
Steele, Jr., author of well-known books on Lisp and C, as well as
Richard Stallman, the developer of GNU CC.  Please join and add your
name to the list.  Membership dues in the League are $42 per year for
programmers, managers and professionals; $10.50 for students; $21 for
others.
</P><P>

The League needs both activist members and members who only pay their
dues.
</P><P>

To join, or for more information, phone (617) 492-0023 or write to:

Here are some suggestions from the League for things you can do to
protect your freedom to write programs:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Don't buy from Xerox, Lotus or Apple.  Buy from their competitors or
from the defendants they are suing.
<P>

<LI>
Don't develop software to work with the systems made by these companies.
<P>

<LI>
Port your existing software to competing systems, so that you encourage
users to switch.
<P>

<LI>
Write letters to company presidents to let them know their conduct
is unacceptable.
<P>

<LI>
Tell your friends and colleagues about this issue and how it threatens
to ruin the computer industry.
<P>

<LI>
Above all, don't work for the look-and-feel plaintiffs, and don't
accept contracts from them.
<P>

<LI>
Write to Congress to explain the importance of this issue.
<P>
