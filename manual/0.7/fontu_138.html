Apple, Lotus and Xerox are trying to create a new form of
legal monopoly: a copyright on a class of user interfaces.  These
monopolies would cause serious problems for users and developers of
computer software and systems.
</P><P>

Until a few years ago, the law seemed clear: no one could restrict
others from using a user interface; programmers were free to implement
any interface they chose.  Imitating interfaces, sometimes with changes,
was standard practice in the computer field.  The interfaces we know
evolved gradually in this way; for example, the Macintosh user interface
drew ideas from the Xerox interface, which in turn drew on work done at
Stanford and SRI.  1-2-3 imitated VisiCalc, and dBase imitated a
database program from JPL.
</P><P>

Most computer companies, and nearly all computer users, were happy with
this state of affairs.  The companies that are suing say it does not
offer "enough incentive" to develop their products, but they must have
considered it "enough" when they made their decision to do so.  It
seems they are not satisfied with the opportunity to continue to compete
in the marketplace--not even with a head start.
</P><P>

If Xerox, Lotus, and Apple are permitted to make law through
the courts, the precedent will hobble the software industry:
</P><P>

Gratuitous incompatibilities will burden users.  Imagine if each
car manufacturer had to arrange the pedals in a different order.
<P>

<LI>
Software will become and remain more expensive.  Users will be
"locked in" to proprietary interfaces, for which there is no real
competition.
<P>

<LI>
Large companies have an unfair advantage wherever lawsuits become
commonplace.  Since they can easily afford to sue, they can intimidate
small companies with threats even when they don't really have a case.
<P>

<LI>
User interface improvements will come slower, since incremental
evolution through creative imitation will no longer be permitted.
<P>

<LI>
Even Apple, etc., will find it harder to make improvements if
they can no longer adapt the good ideas that others introduce, for
fear of weakening their own legal positions.  Some users suggest that
this stagnation may already have started.
<P>

<LI>
If you use GNU software, you might find it of some concern that user
interface copyright will make it hard for the Free Software Foundation
to develop programs compatible with the interfaces that you already
know.
