<p>The GNU font utilities
to allow conversion of a scanned type specimen image into an outline
(PostScript or Metafont) font.  These fonts can be used with
<a href="/software/ghostscript/ghostscript.html">Ghostscript</a> or
<a href="http://tug.org">TeX</a>.

<p>The fontutils has a new maintainer.  Please be patient as the new maintainer
acclimates to the project.</p> 

<p>The current tasks for the new maintainer are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the code to compile against GCC 4.5.2. - DONE</li>
<li>Update the infrastructure to current autoconf. - PENDING</li>
<li>Generate a new release using new autoconf. - PENDING</li>
<li>Work on using gnulib. - PENDING</li>
<li>Add user/developer driven functionality. - PENDING</li>
<li>Remove legacy/deprecated components. - PENDING</li>
<li>Convert to single changelog. - DONE</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the fontutils were originally written in the early 1990's,
other programs have been developed which do a better job of some parts
of this task.  Here is a list of the fontutils programs with indications
of their current status:

<ul>
<li>imgrotate: rotates images 90 degrees, an inefficiently-implemented
subset of pnmrotate (from <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net">netpbm</a>).

<li>imageto: extracts individual characters from a large image; still useful.

<li>fontconvert: some features may still be useful, such as creating a
tfm file from a bitmap.

<li>charspace: allows non-interactive side bearing specification, so
possibly still useful.  On the other hand, <a
href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net">fontforge</a> allows interactive
specification, and has a very nice preview window for testing side
bearings.

<li>gsrenderfont: a shell script that converts outline fonts to bitmaps
at a given size.  This is called from TeX programs under certain
circumstances.  The version here has long been replaced by the scripts
in the TeX distributions.

<li>limn: does the actual conversion from bitmaps to splines. These
days, you're much better off using
<a href="http://autotrace.sourceforge.net">autotrace</a> or
<a href="http://potrace.sourceforge.net">potrace</a>.

<li>bzrto: conversion from the generic homegrown `bzr' (Bezier) format
output by limn to PostScript Type&nbsp;1, PostScript Type&nbsp;3, or
Metafont.  Obsolete.

<li>bpltobzr: translate the binary bzr format into an equivalent text
format `bpl' (bezier property list), for editing.  Fortunately, a
full-featured free outline font editor, <a
href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net">fontforge</a>, has been written
(by George Williams).  Obsolete.

<li>xbfe: bitmap font editor for shapes and metrics; astonishingly, it
seems there are still no bitmap editors for any format except BDF, so
still useful.  Or can fontforge handle other bitmaps?

</ul>

<p>The obsolete programs should probably be removed from the
distribution, but left in the source tree.</p>
